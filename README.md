# US-Household-Income-Data
SQL project focusing on US household income data trends

Prior to living in Los Angeles, I had grown up in the Midwest where prices of housing, cost of living and other various expenses might be considered "moderate" or "normal" in comparison to larger cities. It wasn't until I had officially moved to the West Coast did I become interested in the massive difference in cost of living. As a result, I utilized this US Household Income data to answer some of these key questions below.
 
 
- What are the top five highest earning cities to live in?
- What are the average mean and median incomes per state, scored by the top and bottom 5?
- What are the mean incomes for each “type” and “track” column?
- What are the most expensive boroughs to live in within our highest earning cities?
